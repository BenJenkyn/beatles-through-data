# Beatles Through Data

This project was an assignment created for my Scientific Data Analysis class. The objective of the assignment was to find a dataset and incorporate key aspects of the data science workflow to explore one or more questions related to the dataset. The dataset I've chosen was about The Beatles Songs and the main question I chose to answer was wheather or not the rise and fall of The Beatles can be seen in their music.
